## SIMPLE GUN JS EXAMPLE ##

GUN is a small, easy, and fast protocol for syncing data. Because GUN is small, it can be added to your app to improve a single feature. But because GUN is easy, it can also replace hundreds or thousands of lines of code, networking calls, storage boilerplate, pub/sub routing, cache invalidation, and more. The power of GUN is that it abstracts this complexity into a unified simple API that is very different than traditional systems, with the aim of making it easy to build cool apps quickly.
